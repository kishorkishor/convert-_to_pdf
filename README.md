# KKT File Converter 📄✨

Hey there! 👋

Welcome to the **KKT File Converter**. I built this little tool because I was tired of uploading my private documents to random websites just to convert them to PDF. I wanted something fast, secure, and that runs right in the browser.

So, here it is! It handles things like PowerPoint presentations, images, and documents, turning them into clean PDFs without your data ever leaving your computer.

## See it in action 👀

I'm a big fan of dark mode (who isn't?), but I made sure to include a light mode too for those bright sunny days. Check out the toggle in action:

## Why use this?

*   **Privacy First**: Everything happens locally on your machine. No servers peeking at your files. 🔒
*   **Versatile**: Converts PPTs, Images, and more.
*   **Easy on the Eyes**: Comes with a built-in Dark/Light mode toggle. 🌙/☀️
*   **Fast**: Built with Next.js, so it's snappy.

## How to run it 🚀

If you want to run this locally on your machine, it's super simple.

1.  **Clone the repo** (or just download the files).
2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Fire it up**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
4.  Open `http://localhost:3000` (or `3001` if 3000 is busy) in your browser.

## Tech Stack 🛠️

Just some cool tech I used to put this together:
*   [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - The framework.
*   [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For the styling (and the dark mode magic).
*   Various PDF libraries (`html2pdf.js`, `jspdf`, etc.) to handle the heavy lifting.
